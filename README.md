# arch-i3
i3 is a window manager, a display manager. Unlie complete desktop environments, display managers only *display* the graphical stuff a program wants to display. No utilities are present and the user is given the freedom to choose what they want which greatly improves efficiency.

More info at the Arch wiki here(https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager).

These are my i3 configurations using i3-gaps which is a modified versiion of i3 with the ability to have gaps between windows to improve the aesthetic quality.
